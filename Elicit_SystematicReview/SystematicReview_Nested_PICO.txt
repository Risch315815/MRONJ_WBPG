I would like to make a systematic review or meta analysis 
regarding the risk of Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of Jaw after dental treatment 
between patient who has taken anti-resorptive medication and patient who has not taken such medication. 
Using a PICO search model.

--------------------------------------
//P: Regardless of age and sex, 
1. Osteoporosis patients, excluding cancer patients
2. Cancer patient, excluding osteoporosis patients


//I: History of anti-resorptive medication use, only for  
-
1-1-1. Orally-administered Bisphosphonate medication (alendronate(Fosamax), risedronate(Actonel), etc )
1-1-2. Parenterally-administered Bisphosphonate medication (zoledronate(Boniva), etc )
1-2. Denosumab(Prolia)
1-3. Monoclonal antibody (Romosozumab)
-
2-1. Bisphosphonate medication (Parenteral: zoledronate(Zometa/Reclast), etc)
2-2. Denosumab(Xegva)


//C: no history of anti-resorptive medication use 

//O: incidence of Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of Jaw
1. with no invasive dental treatment
2. after invasive dental procedure (including teeth extraction, periodontal surgery, implant insertion, removable prosthesis, etc)

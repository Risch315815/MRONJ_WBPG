I would like to make a systematic review or meta analysis 
regarding the risk of Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of Jaw after dental treatment 
between patient who has taken anti-resorptive medication and patient who has not taken such medication.

1-2. Denosumab(Prolia)
1-3. Monoclonal antibody (Romosozumab)

2-1. Bisphosphonate medication (Parenteral: zoledronate(Zometa), etc)
2-2. Denosumab(Xegva)


//C: no history of anti-resorptive medication use 

//O: incidence of Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of Jaw after invasive dental procedure (including teeth extraction, periodontal surgery, implant insertion, removable prosthesis, etc)

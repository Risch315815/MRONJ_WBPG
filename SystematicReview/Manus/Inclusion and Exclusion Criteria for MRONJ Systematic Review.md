# Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for MRONJ Systematic Review

## Inclusion Criteria

### Study Types
- Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
- Prospective cohort studies
- Retrospective cohort studies
- Case-control studies
- Cross-sectional studies with clear comparison groups
- Systematic reviews and meta-analyses (for reference checking)

### Population
- Studies including adult patients (â‰¥18 years)
- Studies with clearly defined patient populations:
  - Osteoporosis patients without cancer diagnosis
  - Cancer patients without osteoporosis as primary diagnosis
  - Patients receiving anti-resorptive medications where indication (osteoporosis or cancer) is not specified
- Studies with minimum sample size of 100 subjects
- Studies with adequate follow-up period

### Intervention/Exposure
- Studies reporting on patients with history of anti-resorptive medication use:
  - For osteoporosis: oral/parenteral bisphosphonates, denosumab, or monoclonal antibodies
  - For cancer: parenteral bisphosphonates or denosumab
- Studies with clear documentation of medication type, dosage, duration, and administration route

### Comparison
- Studies including a control group of patients without history of anti-resorptive medication use
- Studies with appropriate matching or adjustment for confounding variables

### Outcomes
- Studies reporting incidence or prevalence of MRONJ
- Studies with clear definition of MRONJ according to established criteria (e.g., AAOMS criteria)
- Studies reporting outcomes separately for patients with and without invasive dental procedures
- Studies with adequate follow-up period to capture MRONJ development

### Language and Publication
- Studies published in English
- Peer-reviewed publications
- Studies published from 2003 onwards (when bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis was first described)

## Exclusion Criteria

### Study Types
- Case reports and case series without control groups
- Narrative reviews without systematic methodology
- Opinion papers, editorials, and letters to the editor
- Conference abstracts without full-text publication
- Animal studies and in vitro studies

### Population
- Studies focusing exclusively on pediatric populations
- Studies with mixed populations where data for osteoporosis and cancer patients cannot be separated

### Study Types
- Studies with sample size less than 100 subjects
- Studies with inadequate follow-up period

### Intervention/Exposure
- Studies focusing on anti-resorptive medications not specified in the PICO framework
- Studies with unclear documentation of medication history
- Studies where medication exposure cannot be clearly attributed to either osteoporosis or cancer treatment

### Comparison
- Studies without a control group
- Studies with inappropriate or poorly defined control groups

### Outcomes
- Studies not reporting MRONJ as a primary or secondary outcome
- Studies with unclear or non-standard definition of MRONJ
- Studies not differentiating between MRONJ with and without invasive dental procedures
- Studies with inadequate follow-up period to capture MRONJ development

### Language and Publication
- Studies not published in English
- Non-peer-reviewed publications
- Studies published before 2003

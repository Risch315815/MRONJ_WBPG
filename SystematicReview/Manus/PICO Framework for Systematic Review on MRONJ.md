# PICO Framework for Systematic Review on MRONJ

## Population (P)
Three distinct patient populations will be examined:

1. **Osteoporosis patients**
   - Patients diagnosed with osteoporosis
   - Excluding patients with cancer diagnosis

2. **Cancer patients**
   - Patients diagnosed with cancer
   - Excluding patients with osteoporosis diagnosis only
   
3. **Indication not specified**
   - Patients receiving anti-resorptive medications where the specific indication (osteoporosis or cancer) is not clearly specified
   - Studies that do not differentiate between osteoporosis and cancer indications

## Intervention (I)
History of anti-resorptive medication use, categorized by:

### For Osteoporosis Patients:
1. **Bisphosphonate medications**
   - 1-1-1: Orally-administered (e.g., alendronate/Fosamax, risedronate/Actonel)
   - 1-1-2: Parenterally-administered (e.g., zoledronate/Boniva)
2. **Denosumab** (Prolia)
3. **Monoclonal antibody** (Romosozumab)

### For Cancer Patients:
1. **Bisphosphonate medications**
   - Primarily parenterally-administered (e.g., zoledronate/Zometa/Reclast)
2. **Denosumab** (Xgeva)

## Comparison (C)
- Patients with no history of anti-resorptive medication use

## Outcomes (O)
Incidence of Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of Jaw (MRONJ) in two scenarios:

1. With no invasive dental treatment
2. After invasive dental procedures, including:
   - Teeth extraction
   - Periodontal surgery
   - Implant insertion
   - Removable prosthesis
   - Other invasive dental procedures

## Study Objective
To compare the incidence of MRONJ between patients who have taken anti-resorptive medications and those who have not, with the ultimate goal of developing an algorithm to predict MRONJ incidence based on:
1. Type of medication
2. Indication for medication (osteoporosis vs. cancer)
3. Dental procedure performed

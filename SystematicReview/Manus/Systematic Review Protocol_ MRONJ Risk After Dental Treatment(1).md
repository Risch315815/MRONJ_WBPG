# Systematic Review Protocol: MRONJ Risk After Dental Treatment

## Title
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (MRONJ) Risk After Dental Treatment: Comparing Patients With and Without Anti-resorptive Medication History

## Background
Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a serious adverse effect associated with anti-resorptive medications used in the treatment of osteoporosis and cancer-related conditions. The risk of developing MRONJ may be influenced by the type of medication, indication for use, and dental procedures performed. This systematic review aims to compare the incidence of MRONJ between patients who have taken anti-resorptive medications and those who have not, with the ultimate goal of developing a predictive algorithm.

## Review Questions
1. What is the incidence of MRONJ in patients with osteoporosis who have taken anti-resorptive medications compared to those who have not?
2. What is the incidence of MRONJ in cancer patients who have taken anti-resorptive medications compared to those who have not?
3. How does the incidence of MRONJ differ between patients who undergo invasive dental procedures and those who do not?
4. What factors influence the risk of developing MRONJ in patients taking anti-resorptive medications?

## Methods

### PICO Framework
- **Population (P)**: Three distinct patient populations:
  1. Osteoporosis patients (excluding cancer patients)
  2. Cancer patients (excluding osteoporosis patients)
  3. Patients receiving anti-resorptive medications where indication (osteoporosis or cancer) is not specified
- **Intervention (I)**: History of anti-resorptive medication use
  - For osteoporosis: oral/parenteral bisphosphonates, denosumab, monoclonal antibodies
  - For cancer: parenteral bisphosphonates, denosumab
- **Comparison (C)**: No history of anti-resorptive medication use
- **Outcomes (O)**: Incidence of MRONJ
  1. With no invasive dental treatment
  2. After invasive dental procedures

### Eligibility Criteria
Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are documented in the accompanying file "inclusion_exclusion_criteria.md".

Key inclusion criteria include:
- Adult patients (≥18 years)
- Minimum sample size of 100 subjects
- Clear documentation of anti-resorptive medication use
- Clearly defined MRONJ outcomes

### Information Sources
The following electronic databases will be searched:
- PubMed/MEDLINE
- Embase
- Cochrane Library
- Web of Science
- Scopus
- CINAHL

Additional sources:
- Reference lists of included studies
- Reference lists of relevant systematic reviews
- Clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP)
- Grey literature sources (OpenGrey, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses)

### Search Strategy
Search terms will be developed based on the PICO framework and will include MeSH terms, keywords, and their combinations. The search strategy will be adapted for each database while maintaining consistency in the core concepts.

Key search concepts will include:
1. MRONJ/BRONJ/ONJ terms
2. Anti-resorptive medication terms (bisphosphonates, denosumab, etc.)
3. Dental procedure terms
4. Osteoporosis and cancer terms

### Study Selection
Two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts of identified studies. Full texts of potentially eligible studies will be retrieved and assessed against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Disagreements will be resolved through discussion or by consulting a third reviewer.

### Data Extraction
A standardized data extraction form will be developed to collect:
- Study characteristics (design, country, year, sample size)
- Patient characteristics (age, sex, underlying condition)
- Intervention details (medication type, dosage, duration, route)
- Comparison group details
- Outcome data (MRONJ incidence, definition used, follow-up period)
- Dental procedure details (if applicable)

### Risk of Bias Assessment
Risk of bias will be assessed using appropriate tools based on study design:
- RCTs: Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0
- Non-randomized studies: ROBINS-I tool
- Observational studies: Newcastle-Ottawa Scale

### Data Synthesis and Analysis
If sufficient homogeneous data are available, meta-analysis will be performed using random-effects models to calculate pooled estimates of MRONJ incidence. Subgroup analyses will be conducted based on:
- Patient population (osteoporosis vs. cancer)
- Medication type and administration route
- Dental procedure type
- Duration of medication exposure

Heterogeneity will be assessed using I² statistics and explored through sensitivity analyses.

### Algorithm Development
Based on the meta-analysis results, a predictive algorithm will be developed to estimate MRONJ risk based on:
- Patient factors (age, sex, underlying condition)
- Medication factors (type, dosage, duration, route)
- Dental procedure factors (type, invasiveness)

The algorithm will be validated using a portion of the extracted data reserved for this purpose.

## 10. Literature Gaps and Limitations

1. **Cancer Patients with Oral Bisphosphonates**: Limited literature specifically on cancer patients treated with oral bisphosphonates, as most cancer patients receive parenteral bisphosphonates or denosumab.

2. **Cancer Patients with Non-Denosumab Monoclonal Antibodies**: Limited data on MRONJ risk with non-denosumab monoclonal antibodies alone; most studies focus on combination therapy with bisphosphonates.

3. **Osteoporosis Patients with Romosozumab**: Relatively new medication with limited long-term data on MRONJ risk.

4. **Dental Procedure-Specific Risk**: While dental extractions are consistently identified as a major risk factor, there is limited data on procedure-specific risk for other dental interventions.

5. **Standardization Issues**: Variation in study design, follow-up periods, and MRONJ diagnostic criteria across studies makes direct comparisons challenging.

6. **Prevention Strategies**: Limited high-quality evidence on the effectiveness of specific prevention strategies for different medication categories.

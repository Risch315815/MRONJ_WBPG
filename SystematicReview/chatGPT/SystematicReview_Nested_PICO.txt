@Original Question

I would like to make a systematic review or meta analysis 
regarding the risk of Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of Jaw after dental treatment 
between patient who has taken anti-resorptive medication and patient who has not taken such medication. 
Using a PICO search model.
--> I would like to compare the incidence of MRONJ between these groups, with the hope of building an algorithm to predict the incidence of MRONJ based on the kind of medication the patient is taking and the indication for the medication. 

--------------------------------------
//P: Regardless of age and sex, 
1. Osteoporosis patients, excluding cancer patients
2. Cancer patient, excluding osteoporosis patients


//I: History of anti-resorptive medication use, only for  
-
1-1-1. Orally-administered Bisphosphonate medication for osteoporosis (alendronate(Fosamax), risedronate(Actonel), etc )
1-1-2. Parenterally-administered Bisphosphonate medication for osteoporosis (zoledronate(Boniva), etc )
1-2. Denosumab for osteoporosis (Prolia)
1-3. Monoclonal antibody for osteoporosis (Romosozumab)
-
2-1. Bisphosphonate medication for cancer (Parenteral: zoledronate(Zometa/Reclast), etc)
2-2. Denosumab for cancer (Xegva)


//C: no history of anti-resorptive medication use 

//O: incidence of Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of Jaw
1. with no invasive dental treatment
2. after invasive dental procedure (including teeth extraction, periodontal surgery, implant insertion, removable prosthesis, etc)

@Screening

- population, age: age of subject must be over 18 years old
- population, indication: the research must specify that its subject is chosen from patients taking medication for osteoporosis, excluding cancer patient, excluding research with mixed population
- subject size: must include over 100 subjects in the final statistical data
- control group: no MRONJ medication history
- intervention type: oral bisphosphonate medication (excluding intravenous, excluding non-bisphosphonate) for osteoporosis treatment
- study design: prospective/retrospective cohort study, case-control study, or randomized controlled trial, excluding case report/series
- diagnostic standards for MRONJ
- procedure documentation: MRONJ incidence following clearly documented invasive dental procedures (including dental extraction, dental surgery, implant surgery, periodontal surgery, removable prosthesis, etc)
- MRONJ latency: document the time interval between [start of medication to dental procedure], and [dental procedure to MRONJ incidence].
- MRONJ incidence, and have a follow up period at least 6 months

@ baseline incidence:

There are multiple level of baseline regarding MRONJ incidence:

for Osteoporosis as indication for antiresorptive medication use
1. incidence of spontaneous osetonecrosis of jaw in subjects with (NO antiresorptive medication history)
2. incidence of spontaneous osetonecrosis of jaw in subjects with (antiresorptive medication history) AND (NO invasive dental treatment)
2-1. incidence of spontaneous osetonecrosis of jaw in subjects with (SPECIFIC KIND of antiresorptive medication history) AND (NO invasive dental treatment)
3. incidence of spontaneous osetonecrosis of jaw in subjects with (antiresorptive medication history) AND (invasive dental treatment)
3-1. 2-1. incidence of spontaneous osetonecrosis of jaw in subjects with (SPECIFIC KIND of antiresorptive medication history) AND (invasive dental treatment)

as is the same for indication for cancer as indication for antiresorptive medication use
